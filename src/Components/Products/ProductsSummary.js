				<h2>Cookies Forever</h2>
				<p>
					When it comes to cookies, it's hard to beat a warm, freshly baked
					batch featuring the dynamic duo of oats and raisins. Each sweet,
					lightly spiced bite of a chewy oatmeal cookie is like catching up with
					an old friend - a friend that you can eat.
				</p>
				<p>
					All our cookies are baked with high-quality ingredients, just-in-time
					and of course by experienced chefs!
				</p>
